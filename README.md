# reVC — GameCube

A Nintendo GameCube port of Grand Theft Auto: Vice City, based on the
reverse-engineered engine from [mrxenginner/reVC](https://github.com/mrxenginner/reVC).

The port targets real GameCube hardware constraints: the heap is limited to
the console's 24 MB of MEM1, audio sample storage uses the 16 MB ARAM, and
MEM2 (Wii-only memory) is never used — including in the Wii development
build, which enforces the same limits.

## Status

Work in progress.

- The game boots and plays from an **SD card** (Wii homebrew loader, or
  Dolphin).
- Generating a mini-DVD **ISO that boots on a real GameCube does not work
  yet**. The ISO9660 path runs under Dolphin, but real-hardware disc boot is
  an open problem.

## Architecture

- **Renderer** — a native GX backend for librw
  (`vendor/librw/src/gx`). Textures are converted ahead of time to
  GameCube-native formats (CMPR / RGB5A3) at full original quality; memory
  pressure is handled by streaming and eviction, not by reducing asset
  quality. World geometry is quantised to packed int16 vertex streams,
  static meshes can be replayed as GP display lists, and lighting is
  implemented with TEV stages (prelight plus timecycle ambient, with
  optional env-map, rim-light and lightmap stages).
- **Audio** — streamed music, radio and speech are Ogg Vorbis, decoded with
  Tremor (fixed-point) on a dedicated thread so decoding never interrupts
  the game frame. Mixing uses AESND's 32 hardware voices. Mission speech
  (IMA ADPCM) is cached in ARAM. FMVs are decoded with Theora.
- **Filesystem and streaming** — an ISO9660 driver written for this port
  (`src/skel/gamecube/dvdfs.c`) plus libfat SD support, with sector-aligned
  DMA reads and a streaming layer tuned for the 24 MB memory budget.
- **Frontend** — a GameCube controls page with a 3D controller model, and
  help boxes that display the port's actual button bindings as coloured
  GameCube button badges.

## Building

```bash
git clone --recursive https://github.com/origami-ltd/gamecube-reVC.git
cd gamecube-reVC
python3 build.py --setup    # installs the dependencies for your OS
python3 build.py            # GameCube DOL -> build/cube/src/reVC.dol
python3 build.py wii        # Wii dev DOL  -> build/wii/src/reVC.dol
```

The same commands work on macOS, Linux and Windows. `--setup` uses the
system package manager (Homebrew, apt, pacman or winget) for CMake and
Ninja, then installs [devkitPro](https://devkitpro.org/wiki/Getting_Started)
with the `gamecube-dev` and `wii-dev` package groups. All other build
dependencies are included in the repository (the librw fork with the GX
backend, the xiph ogg/opus/opusfile submodules, and a PowerPC libtheora
build with a Wii toolchain file under `vendor/portlibs/`).

### Installing the dependencies manually

Requirements: Python 3, CMake ≥ 3.13, Ninja, and devkitPro with the
GameCube/Wii toolchains.

- **macOS** — `brew install cmake ninja`, then install
  [devkitPro pacman](https://github.com/devkitPro/pacman/releases)
  (`.pkg` installer) and run
  `sudo dkp-pacman -Sy gamecube-dev wii-dev`.
- **Debian/Ubuntu** — `sudo apt-get install cmake ninja-build`, then run the
  [devkitPro pacman bootstrap](https://apt.devkitpro.org/install-devkitpro-pacman)
  and `sudo dkp-pacman -Sy gamecube-dev wii-dev`.
- **Arch Linux** — `sudo pacman -S cmake ninja`, add the
  [devkitPro repositories](https://devkitpro.org/wiki/devkitPro_pacman) to
  `/etc/pacman.conf` and `sudo pacman -Sy gamecube-dev wii-dev`.
  **Fedora** - `sudo dnf install cmake ninja-build`, then follow the instructions
  to install [devkitPro Pacman](https://devkitpro.org/wiki/devkitPro_pacman)
  and `sudo pacman -Sy gamecube-dev wii-dev`.
- **Windows** — `winget install Kitware.CMake Ninja-build.Ninja`, then run
  the [devkitPro installer](https://github.com/devkitPro/installer/releases)
  and select the GameCube and Wii development packages.

If devkitPro is installed somewhere non-standard, set the `DEVKITPRO`
environment variable to its root.

## Game data

This repository contains no game assets. A legally owned copy of Grand
Theft Auto: Vice City is required.

Copy the game installation to `assets/GTAVC` (the [`assets/`](assets/)
folder is git-ignored) and run:

```bash
python3 build.py sd         # SD card tree -> assets/sd-tree
```

This builds the ahead-of-time texture converter for your machine, converts
every texture to GX-native formats, repacks `gta3.img` and lays out the
card tree the game reads (`tools/gamecube/build_sd.py` does the asset
work; `--game`, `--out`, `--audio` and `--movies` override the defaults).

## Running

### Dolphin

1. Build the SD card tree (see [Game data](#game-data)).
2. Point Dolphin's Wii SD card at it: `Config → Wii → SD Card Settings`,
   then either set the SD card image to one whose **root** holds the tree's
   contents, or enable folder sync targeting the tree itself (the sync root
   becomes the card root). Either way the card must end up with
   `/models/gta3.img` at the top level.
3. Open `build/wii/src/reVC.dol` in Dolphin.

### Wii (Homebrew Channel)

1. Generate the SD card tree (see [Game data](#game-data)) and copy its
   **contents** — the `anim/`, `audio/`, `data/`, `models/`, `text/` and
   remaining folders `build_sd.py` produced — directly to the **root** of a
   FAT32 SD card. The game reads them from the root: the card must contain
   `/models/gta3.img`, not `/sd-tree/models/gta3.img`.
2. Copy `build/wii/src/reVC.dol` to the card as `apps/reVC/boot.dol`.
3. Launch reVC from the Homebrew Channel.

### GameCube

Real-hardware disc boot is not functional yet — see [Status](#status).
